This folder contains example notebooks that demonstrate how ViMMS can be used in different scenarios:

- **01. Download Data.ipynb** downloads and pre-process the example data used in other notebooks. Please run this first.
- **02. MS1 Simulations.ipynb** performs full-scan MS1 simulation on a single sample. This corresponds to Section 3.1 of the paper.
- **03. Multiple Samples Example.ipynb** performs full-scan MS1 simulation on multiple samples.
- **04. Top-N Simulations.ipynb** performs Top-N Data-Dependant Acquisition protocol on a single sample derived from an existing experimental file and compares the results. This corresponds to Section 3.2 of the paper.
- **05. Varying N in Top-N Simulations.ipynb** performs an experiment where we vary *N* for Top-N in ViMMS and plot the changes to fragmentation performance. This corresponds to Section 3.3 of the paper.
- **DsDA/DsDA_controller.ipynb** performs the DsDA experiment as described in the paper. This corresponds to Section 3.5 of the paper.
